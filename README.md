# BeautifulSoup

### Minimum Viable Product
- As a core application the user chooses how they are feeling (a mood) as soon as they enter the website, and based on the mood selection a song playlist is generated.
- User story: "I want to select how I am feeling and be provided a playlist of music that matches my current mood."

### Features
1. We at BeautifulSoup understand that people's personalities influence the music they like. We want to be able to distinguish between personalities and let people select a mood that suggests music tailored to their personality.

2. The user can share their mood with a friend, and the friend can suggest a song to appropriately support or modify the given mood.
For example: User 1 selects (ðŸ˜¢) and shares the song and the mood (ðŸ˜¢) with a friend (User 2). User 2 suggests a song with mood (ðŸ˜„) to User 1. User 1 listens to the recommended song and updates mood from (ðŸ˜¢) to (ðŸ¤”) and eventually (ðŸ˜†).

3. Allow the user to import playlists from different platforms, then use his/her suggestions to sort the songs into different mood categories.

4. User can elect to include, in addition to their current mood, how they would like to feel. The resulting playlist would contain music likely to facilitate that transition.

5. Provide a feedback mechanism to the user to communicate whether a song or playlist is having the desired effect.
