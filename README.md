# BeautifulSoup

### Minimum Viable Product
- As a core application the user can choose a particular mood or a selection as soon as they go on the website, and based on the mood selection a playlist is shown.

### Features
1. We at BeautifulSoup understand that people's personalities can be different. We want to be able to distinguish between personalities and let people select a mood based on their respective personalities.

2. The user can select their mood with a friend, and the friend can suggest a song in return to change a mood or to lighten up someone's mood( for ex. Let's say User 1 selects (ðŸ˜¢) shares the song and the mood with a friend (User 2). User 2 suggests a song with mood (ðŸ˜„). User1 changes mood from (ðŸ˜¢) to (ðŸ¤”) and eventually (ðŸ˜†)

3. Allow the user to import playlists from different platforms, then use his/her suggestions to sort the songs into different mood categories.
